# Clustering
# Description
This project focuses on comparing the performance of three clustering algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Mean Shift Clustering. The aim is to assess how different pre-processing techniques impact the effectiveness of these algorithms using various evaluation metrics.
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that organizes similar data points into distinct groups or clusters. This project utilizes a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, suitable for clustering analysis. The performance of the three algorithms is evaluated based on several clustering evaluation metrics.
